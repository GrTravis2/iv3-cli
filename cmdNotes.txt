iv3-cli cmd plans:

-cli needs to:
	-issue commands from iv3 lib for testing
	-have cfg command available to setup camera for operation, make camera struct and other settings as required
	-go into run mode, send cli into mode where it continuously runs after receiving some input and displays results/stats

-cmds available to camera (* = optional/nice-to-haves)
	-trigger cam and read results
		-leaving note, will need to have way to listen for trigger i/o. Need a button or something...
		-flags/args: *maybe have loop arg for testing? how many times to trigger?
	-read camera info
		-flags/args: none
	-change program

	-read camera stats
		-flags/args: none
	-read camera error
